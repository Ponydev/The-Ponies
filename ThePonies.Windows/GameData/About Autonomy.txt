The Ponies will feature autonomy, meaning that all ponies will be able to randomly select their own interactions
based on their needs, which will make the game world feel more alive. (However, autonomy can be turned off in the
game settings.)

Whatever pony is currently selected and being played will still have autonomy enabled, but will only take affect
if there is no player intervention with the pony within a few seconds. Unplayed ponies will constantly be making
their own interaction choices suitable for their needs and the liveliness of the world.
