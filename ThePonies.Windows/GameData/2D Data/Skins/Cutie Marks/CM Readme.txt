The cutie marks in this folder are free-to-use by LazingAbout94 on DeviantArt. They will be used as pre-made selectable cutie marks in Create a Pony. There will also be a feature for players to create their own cutie marks inside or outside the game. Inside the game will feature a basic imaging tool to create cutie marks, which are stored in the UserData folder. Cutie marks made outside of the game can be stored in an external folder (maybe) in The Ponies folder in Documents, or in the game folders itself.
