Game Lighting


The game will use a shader to render morning/day/evening/night cycles, which will make the scene feel lively and detailed.

Depending on the amount of light sources within a certain room (closed in area) the light will either be
more dim or more bright. These particular light sources refer to lamps and placement of windows for the
room.
