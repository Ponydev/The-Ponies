# The Ponies
![PoniesLogoGH](PoniesLogoGH.png)

Project aiming to create a free-to-play pony life simulator, inspired by the design and gameplay of the original Sims game.

# Looking for developers!

Despite already having a team, we're always welcoming any developers interested in helping the game's development. The main things we're looking for include:
  - C# programmers
  - 3D animators and modelers
  - Music artists

# Proposed features

In The Ponies, you will be able to create their own ponies as you see fit, and control their every move. Take them down the right paths in life, or make a complete mess of things. Build the world around them including their homes and the places they visit. Every choice is up to you.
